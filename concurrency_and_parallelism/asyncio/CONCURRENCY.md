# Concurrency

**asyncio** is a concurrency framework in Python that allows you to write asynchronous code using async and await keywords.<br> 
It is designed for I/O-bound tasks and non-blocking operations. When using asyncio, tasks are executed concurrently, but not necessarily in parallel.<br> 
The event loop manages the execution of tasks, switching between them when they are waiting for I/O operations to complete.<br>
